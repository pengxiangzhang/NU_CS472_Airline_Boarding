# Airplane Boarding

The terminal parking rate for an aircraft is extremely expensive. A change in boarding strategy may affect boarding efficiency and enhance the airplane's turnaround time, which may lower airline costs.

An agent-based model that uses Netlogo to simulate different boarding strategies on different size airplanes could reduce the time required for airplane boarding.
